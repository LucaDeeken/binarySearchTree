### Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation
This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) in JavaScript, featuring methods to build, traverse, insert, delete, and rebalance the tree. The tree is initialized from an array, and its operations are optimized for efficiency, leveraging the properties of BSTs for fast insertions and deletions.

- **Features Node class:** 
A class for tree nodes, storing data and references to left and right children.
- **Tree class:**
A class to represent the binary search tree, with methods to build the tree, insert and delete nodes, find nodes, and traverse the tree in various ways.
- **Traversal methods:**
- Methods to traverse the tree in Level Order, Pre-Order, In-Order, and Post-Order.
- **Rebalancing:**
- The tree can be rebalanced to ensure that it remains efficient by maintaining a balanced structure.
- **Height and Depth calculations:**
- Functions to calculate the height and depth of nodes.
- **Balanced Tree Check:**
- A function to check if the tree is balanced (height difference between left and right subtrees is at most 1).
